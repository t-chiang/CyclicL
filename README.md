# CyclicL

Still untitled, the work in this repository is to bring a tool for agile developers that work in safety critical systems engineering. The goal of this tool is to automate the development of traceability matrices while enabling an iterative approach to system and safety engineering. It combines requirements modelling with class diagram modelling and product line modelling. This tool will allow iterative development through bi-directional transformations between requirements phase and design phase engineering. As this development takes place, a traceability matrix is automatically populated in the requirements modelling environment, along with verification of the design and validation of the requirements. Still incomplete, everything in this repo is still only available to be opened in developer mode as opposed to an Eclipse plugin. Once a stable version has been reached an Eclipse plugin will be released along with proper documentation of how to use the tool.
